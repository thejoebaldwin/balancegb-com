<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With back to school

right around the corner I&rsquo;m reminded of something that concerns

me about the children in our community.  As I watch children walking

home from school a majority of them are lugging backpacks that are

too heavy, fit them poorly, and contort their bodies.  Add the fact

that it is becoming increasingly popular to have one-strapped packs

or to have a backpack slung over one shoulder and you have a recipe

for problems.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the U.S.

product and safety commission, in 2003 alone <B>21,000</B> people

were treated in emergency rooms, doctor&rsquo;s offices and clinics

for backpack related injuries.  In many cases backpack misuse sets

the groundwork for problems that do not show up until years later.

Another scary fact is that backpack misuse leads to long lasting

chronic problems in millions of children.  I see children in my

practice every day that have high shoulders, low hips and unnatural

spinal curvatures that can be caused and accentuated by poor backpack

use.  Backpack misuse leads to the spine being uneven which in turn

produces nervous system (the master control of the body) imbalance. 

This can show up as pain, abnormal sensation, muscle inequality or

improper organ control.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	A recent study in

Italy found that the average child carries a backpack that would be

equivalent to a 39-pound burden on a 176-pound man, or a 29-pound

load for a 132-pound woman.  8 percent of the children studied carry

more than 30 percent of their body weight at least once a week. 

Also, the study found that of the children carrying heavy backpacks,

60 percent had experienced back pain as a direct result.  Another

Italian study found that 79.1 percent of children feel that their

backpacks are too heavy, 65.7 percent felt fatigued due to carrying

their backpack and 46.1 percent had experienced back pain after

wearing a backpack.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	Chiropractors, medical

doctors, orthopedists and physical therapists nationwide have seen a

recent increase in children presenting with back and shoulder

complaints.  This problem has become so prevalent that several states

including California and New Jersey have recently passed legislation

to force school districts to develop ways of reducing the weight of

students&rsquo; backpacks.</P>

<H1 CLASS="western">TIPS TO PREVENT BACKPACK MISSUSE</H1>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

</P>

<UL>

	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Backpack should

	weigh no more than <B>10 percent</B> of a child&rsquo;s body weight.

	 A heavier backpack will cause your child to compensate by leaning

	forward.  This posture over time can lead to neck, back and shoulder

	pain.  

	</P>

</UL>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

</P>

<UL>

	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The backpack

	should never hang more than <B>4 inches</B> below the waistline. 

	The lower a backpack hangs the more it increases pressure on a

	child&rsquo;s shoulders.  This also leads to a leaning forward

	posture. 

	</P>

</UL>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

</P>

<UL>

	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Urge your child to

	<B>wear both shoulder straps</B>.  Avoid all one-strap bags. 

	Educate your children that if they wear only one strap they will end

	up with one shoulder being 6 inches higher than the other and a

	spinal curve to the opposite side.  That is not cool!</P>

</UL>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

</P>

<UL>

	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Wide, padded

	shoulder straps</B> are important.  Non-padded straps dig into a

	child&rsquo;s shoulders and lead to poor posture.  Backpack should

	have <B>adjustable shoulder straps</B> to ensure that the backpack

	can be fitted to your child&rsquo;s body. 

	</P>

</UL>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

</P>

<UL>

	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lumbar curve

	support and hip belts are an added plus that help distribute more

	weight to the pelvis.  This supports the body&rsquo;s natural

	posture and spinal curves.</P>

</UL>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

</P>

<UL>

	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Always pack

	heavier items closest to the child&rsquo;s back.  Pack pointy or

	bulky objects away from the child&rsquo;s back.  Pack to assure that

	items do not shift around.</P>

</UL>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

</P>

<UL>

	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Choose lightweight

	backpacks with multiple compartments to allow even distribution of

	weight throughout the backpack.</P>

</UL>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

</P>

<UL>

	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Look for

	ergonomically designed backpacks like the AirPack that I offer my

	patients.  The Air pack has been shown in studies to reduce the

	effective load on a child&rsquo;s spine up to 80%.</P>

</UL>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Possibly the most

important tip that I can give parents on backpack safety is to pay

close attention to your child each day they are wearing a backpack. 

They should be able to maintain their natural posture while wearing

it.  This means that they should have their ears over their shoulders

(that are also over theirs hips and ankles).  Correct posture also

means that their hips and shoulders should be at equal levels.  Any

sustained deviation from this posture should be investigated by a

healthcare professional, hopefully before symptoms show up. 

Remember, as with most things it&rsquo;s easier to prevent these

problems before your child has back pain.
