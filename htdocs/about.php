<h2>ABOUT DR ANDY</h2>
<p>
Back in high school traveling to the YMCA to play basketball with friends changed my life forever. On
that cold rainy day I had another vehicle pull right in front of me as my car was passing through a busy
intersection. In the aftermath, it was hard to tell that a twisted pile of black metal was actually my car.
Luckily I came out in better shape than the car! At least at first. The whiplash cuts and bruises were not
that bad. The bad part came two weeks later when back pain and sciatica set in. I had never experienced
anything like that in my life. It felt like my leg was going to fall off! This is where chiropractic comes in. I
am fortunate enough to have an uncle who is a doctor of chiropractic. The relief that the adjustments gave
me gave the almost 2 hour drive to my Uncle's practice well worth it. One thing that struck me was that
this was unlike any doctors office that I had ever been in. I stood in disbelief as I watched patient after
patient come in and out - smiling!!. Never before had I been involved in "health care" that wasn't all gloom
and doom, sickness and disease. I discovered that there is a health care profession where not only is the
doctor happy to be there, but the patient is too. Instead of being surrounded by patients who were sick and
suffering, I met people who were excited and grateful to be there. Not only that, the doctor was even more
thrilled to be doing what he was doing.That was when I made up my mind to become a chiropractor, no matter what it took. It was so radically
different from everything else I had seen, that it amazed and attracted me.

I went on to complete my pre-chiropractic studies at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire, before
continuing onto the prestigious Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa, the birthplace of
chiropractic. While there I was fortunate to have great academic and clinical success. Since getting my
Doctor of Chiropractic degree, I have continued my education and I'm completing a Certified Pediatric
Chiropractor degree in 2011. I have also received additional education in Gonstead technique, cranial work,
TMJ therapies, sacro-occipital technique and I am Webster technique certified (balancing of the pregnant
woman's pelvis.
</p>
<p>
I have to admit my philosophy has changed since that first adjustment as a teenager. Like most people, I
came for and got pain relief from Chiropractic. Now I see it as a conscious HEALTH care decision. I know
that my body heals faster, functions better and adapts to it's environment more efficiently under chiropractic
care. My style as a doctor has also developed over time. Born out of the golden rule, I strive to give each
patient a unique experience specific to them on each visit. I stay attune to the adaptations in your body and
adjust my approach and technique appropriately. Being my patient is care of unique you - not two minutes
of cookie cutter treatment.
</p>
<p>
I am blessed by a great family. My beautiful wife, Kelly, is the rock. She has just as much of a role of
keeping our family healthy as I do. She is an outstanding cook and the most nurturing mother I have come
across. Our son, Jackson, is 6 and always has a smile on his face. The most optimistic and friendly person
I have ever met. Our daughter, Emmy, is 3 and LOVES puppies (especially our cockapoo, Lucy). She is a
gorgeous and sweet little girl that gives the best hugs in the world! I spend every possible second that I can
with my family. To me, there is nothing better than watching with Kelly in amazement as my children learn
and explore their world.
</p>
<p>
In my spare time I am addicted to golf. I love working on my golf game, enhancing my golf fitness,
teaching golf and helping my patients achieve a higher quality of golf (from a balanced spine and nervous
system). I also enjoy playing baseball with Jackson, getting on the floor to make believe with Emmy,
playing board games or coloring with the whole family, hanging out with my college friends and visiting my
brother in Denver. I am an avid sports fan and follow the Packers and Brewers very close. I love a good
movie and a video game or two.
</p>

<p>

My own personal health is always a top priority. How else can I be at the top of my game with my patients?

I continue to get adjusted every 2 weeks after over 15 years under care. I also do all that I can to keep

my body and spine in optimum shape by eating right, moving right and thinking right. I believe that these

actions are the foundation of why I almost never get sick without the need of any medication. I am a firm

believer in "walking my own talk" for my patients, and my own children, and would never expect a patient to

do something I am not.

<a name="chiropractic"/> <h2>ABOUT CHIROPRACTIC </h2>

<p>

Since the beginning of time we have known that people possess qualities and skills that help others in

their community reach a higher potential. This transfer of energy from one human being to another can

amplify the quality of life you enjoy and bring about a higher state of health. Chiropractic is a healing

art that reconnects the patient to the intelligence that resides within them. It is the most commonly

utilized "alternative healthcare" in the world today.

</p>

<p>

Chiropractic is the science and art which utilizes the inherent recuperative powers of the body, and

addresses the relationship between the spinal column and nervous system which is responsible in the

restoration and maintenance of health. It is holistic, as a person's entire body and lifestyle are examined.

It is vitalistic in that it balances life energy as well as physical structure of the body. When working with

a chiropractor to improve your health, lifestyle recommendations (diet, posture, exercise, and stress

management) are often made, so as to address the underlying cause of the problem.

</p>

<p>

Chiropractic is more about the nervous system than it is the spine. The nervous system is the master

controller of all living cells, tissues and organs; orchestrating and coordinating all cellular functions. The

spinal column encases the nervous system (spinal cord and nerve roots) and is responsible for its protection.

Because of this intimate relationship, biomechanical and structural problems in the spinal column can

irritate parts of the enclosed nervous system. This irritation can result from noxious inflammatory

biochemicals released during tissue injury or may result from direct mechanical pressure. In either case,

the functioning of the nervous system is negatively influenced as is the functioning of the cells, tissues

and organs which are supplied by the affected nerve(s). The resulting ailment(s) depends on the cells,

tissues and organs affected as well as the extent of nervous system compromise. In short, because the

body's innate recuperative powers are affected by and integrated through the nervous system, correcting

spinal abnormalities which irritate the nervous system can lead to a number of favorable results in patients

suffering from various, seemingly non-spinal health conditions. In short, chiropractic allows the body

function, adapt, move and communicate at a higher level.

 <a name="balance"/><h2>ABOUT BALANCE </h2>

<p>

The essence of life comes down to one word: BALANCE. Life is all about various paradoxes and the only

way to appropriately manage them is by balancing the two of them. Balancing the work you do with

your family and personal life. Balancing enjoying material things with finding meaning in the world.

Balancing making things happen with letting them happen. Balancing reaching for your potential with

enjoying the present moment. Balancing relationships by being equally firm and friendly. Balancing

your head (being rational and logical) with your heart (being compassionate and caring). Balancing

freedom and spontaneity with responsibility and goal setting.

</p>

<p>

The same is true about the human body. The law of homeostasis always reigns supreme. A happy

medium is where the potential of the human body is fully expressed. Countless checks and balances are

involved including; body temperature, acid-base balance (ph), O2 to CO2 balance, osmotic balance of

the body's water content and hormone balance. If the body deviates too far to one extreme function

and adaptation suffer.

</p>

<p>

In chiropractic the goal is to achieve balance of the neural and musculoskeletal systems. The body

works best moving from the center of gravity or balance left to right and front to back. The spine works

best when symmetrical side to side while maintaining it's three front to back curvatures. Muscles,

tissues and organs work best when communication from the nervous system is symmetrical and

appropriate.

</p>

<p>

I welcome you to discover the benefits of a balanced spine and nervous system through safe and natural

chiropractic care!
