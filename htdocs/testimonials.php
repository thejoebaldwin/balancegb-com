<h2>Hope</h2>
<p>
"I've struggled for years with a hip issue, paid thousands for physical therapy and other doctors to be told that I would never get better. I had lost all hope until I 
found Dr. Andy, now I'm on the path to being pain free once again. Thanks for once again giving me hope Andy!

<p>
"Dr. Andy has been treating myself, my family, and has seen numerous House of Speed athletes. Couldn't be more happier with the results, but most importantly the knowledge
and professionalism that he demonstrates. He is extremely caring towards his athletes and patients. I love the fact that he is always looking for better results and better 
ways to treat. It gets all of us back to what we love doing sooner."

<h2> Joe Baldwin, Humboldt Technology Group</h2>
<p>
"My family and I have been seeing Dr. Andy for 3 years now, and I am happy to say our overall health is better because of it. Not only does Dr. Andy have an incredible depth of
knowledge in all manner of health issues, but he has treated a full range of patients within our family: my newbord, my 5 and 3 year olds, and myself. In each case he has explained
what he is doing, and why he is doing it in terms that are easy to understand. He has also made me interested in my own health, and given me the tools to improve it on my own!"
